## About Me
Actuarial Science graduate (Second Class Honours, Upper Division) from Karatina University, with training from WorldQuant University's Applied Data Science Lab. Skilled in data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, visualization, and predictive modeling. Eager to apply analytical skills in data-driven roles.

## Featured Projects
title: "What Drives Real Estate Prices in Mexico?"
 "Analyzed factors like size and location using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Key: Property size dominates price variation."
 
title: "Predicting Apartment Prices in Buenos Aires"
 "Built iterative Linear Regression models on property data. Applied hyperparameter tuning and residuals analysis for accurate pricing insights."

title: "Forecasting Air Quality in Beijing"
 "Compared AR/ARMA time series models vs. Linear Regression on pollution data. Used walk-forward validation for public health predictions."
  
title: "Earthquake Damage Prediction in Nepal"
 "Predicted building damage with Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. Optimized for disaster preparedness and resource allocation."
